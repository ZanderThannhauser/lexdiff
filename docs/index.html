              <section> <h1> Description </h1>
                         <p> Sometimes a line-by-line comparison
                             can be too coarse for small differences and a
                             character-by-character comparison too pedantic to be helpful;
                             lexdiff attempts to reach a middle-ground by essentially
                             comparing the tokens (words) of the two files, similar to how
                             humans read text. lexdiff provides a mechanism
                             for the user to be able to articulate the kinds
                             of tokens lexdiff should be prepared to encounter in the two
                             files and the amount of importance the differences between
                             said tokens have. After the comparison, lexdiff will print a
                             "score" to summarize the differences found. </p>
                         
                         <p>  lexdiff looks for three kinds of differences: a token
                              present in <u>after</u> but is not in <u>before</u> (extra),
                              a token present in <u>before</u> but not in <u>after</u>
                              (missing), and a token present in both files but whose
                              characters are different (similar but not exact).
                              Each of these differences may result in the score increasing
                              or decreasing. The score may also be affected by tokens that
                              perfectly match between the two files (exact). </p>
                                
                         <p>  lexdiff reads the specification file given on the command-line
                              to know what tokens exist, and how the final score should
                              be affected by differences their involved in. </p> </section>
               
              <section> <h1> Specification File Syntax </h1>
                         <p>  The syntax of the specification file is made up of one or
                              more token declarations, each token declaration consists
                              of the regular expression for matching the token followed
                              by a list of differences and the score loss or gain
                              that would occur every time that kind of difference was detected.
                              Example shown below: </p>
                         <pre><code>[<span style="color:#5F5">'0'</span>-<span style="color:#5F5">'9'</span>]+: {
    <span style="color:#5FF">extra</span>: <span style="color:#F55">-10</span>,
    <span style="color:#5FF">similar</span>: <span style="color:#F55">-5</span>,
    <span style="color:#5FF">exact</span>: <span style="color:#F55">+1</span>,
    <span style="color:#5FF">missing</span>: <span style="color:#F55">-20</span>,
};</code></pre>
                         <p>  The number of points gained/lost does not have to be just
                              a numeric literal, lexdiff supports evaluating math expressions
                              to determine the result. Addition, subtraction,
                              multiplication, and sectionision operators are supported.
                              Parenthesis can be used to change the operator precedence. </p>
                  
                         <p>  Unless specified, the number of points gained/lost due
                              to a difference (extra, similar, missing) or an
                              exact match is zero.</p>
                       
                    <section> <h2> Regular Expression Syntax </h2>
                               <p> The regular expression syntax has been modified a bit from
                                   what's conventional. This alternative syntax allows for
                                   better readability and makes it easy to introduce new
                                   operators without breaking old patterns. It could also
                                   be that I've been looking at C code for too long and
                                   have gotten to the point where I don't like any syntax
                                   that doesn't remind me of C.</p>
                               <p> Regardless: In order of operator
                                   precedence: vertical-bar (|) is the or/union operator,
                                   concatenation is done by juxtaposition, question mark (?),
                                   asterisk (*) and plus (+) are the 0-or-1, 0-or-more, and
                                   1-or-more suffix operators respectively. Parenthesis can
                                   be used to change operator precedence.
                                   Including text in a pattern is done with C-style strings
                                   and character literals.</p>
                               <p> Character sets can also be used
                                   in a regular-expression pattern, enclosed in
                                   square brackets ([]). The operators that can be used
                                   to define a character set are, in order of
                                   operator precedence: vertical bar (|) as the set-union
                                   operator, ampersand (&) as the set-intersection operator,
                                   minus (-) as the range/span operator, and exclamation
                                   mark as the prefix set-complement operator. Parenthesis can
                                   be used to change operator precedence. Characters can
                                   included by C-style character literals.</p>

              <section> <h1> Building </h1>
                    <p>  The source code for lexdiff can be found on its
                         <a href="https://github.com/ZanderThannhauser/lexdiff">Github page</a>.
                         Building lexdiff is fairly simple, run 'make' to build and
                         'make install' to install. Lexdiff depends on the
                         GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) on
                         compile time, so make sure that's installed first!
                         On Ubuntu, this can be installed with the
                         command 'sudo apt install libgmp-dev'.
                         The installation prefix defaults
                         to ${HOME}/bin, this can be changed by setting it in
                         the call to make: 'make install PREFIX=/something/else'.</p> </section>
              
              <section> <h1> Notes </h1>
                    <h2> The Tokenizer </h2>
                    <p>  It is worth noting that lexdiff's tokenization is greedy,
                         meaning that it will always try to put characters into
                         the largest token it can.</p>
                    <p>  Sometimes a string could be identified as either one token
                         or another, lexdiff will resolve this ambiguity by using
                         the token declared later in the specification file. </p> </section>
